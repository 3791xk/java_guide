# Template
This is an incredibly basic template you can use to create and run code with. If you have VSCode and Java Extensions installed, this file is enough of a baseline to get your code running. Yes, you need a full Java project when creating something complex, but for now we can learn the basics here. Create a new folder for each project assignment in this curriculum and put the Main.java file in it. Packages and such can be added and used later when deadling with multiple classes. 

**Note**: If you want to go into Java development, I'd highly reccomend downloading Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA and learning those instead. 


```java
// Java is very class and object based, so a class is necessary for our code to run. 
// This is the Main class definition:
public class Main {

  // This is the main method, every application must have this main method in it once
  // This is where the actual thread of the program begins running:
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // CODE GOES HERE
  }

}
```
