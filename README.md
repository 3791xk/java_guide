Guide to learning Java for beginners. In my opinion Java is well suited to be a first language for someone going into Computer Science. Somebody only looking to quickly learn to code should just learn Python and go on with their lives, but isn't necessarily an ideal start for deeper understanding. I've found the lack of variable types and variable instantiation in languages like Python to confuse beginners when their code fails over issues of type or scope, and the use of indents (while convenient for more experienced developers) over brackets furthers this issue and makes their debugging slower and more difficult. Java syntax provides very clear guidelines and this very paticular structure supports the learning process. Once someone knows Java, they can also easily switch and learn other languages like Python, C++, C#, or C (especially when learning data structures and pointers later on). This is a nice start to programming.

## Curriculum

1. Variables + Variable Types
2. Strings
3. Conditionals
4. For + While Loops
5. Arrays + ArrayLists
6. Methods
7. Recursion

**For each lesson, complete the corresponding [Project](https://github.com/3791xk/java_guide/tree/main/projects) and [Puzzle](https://github.com/3791xk/java_guide/tree/main/puzzles).** Projects also list [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) exercises you should complete alongisde each lesson, I highly reccomend you create an account and use these practice problems to further hone your skills.
