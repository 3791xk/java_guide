# Mad Libs Game
## Instructions:
Create a fill in the blanks game that takes specific user input and then outputs a generated story. First ask for all of the user input one entry at a time, then print the whole story and end the story with an ASCII Art cat. Start with these starting sentences (Fig. 1) and then finish the story however you want as long as you include all of the String manipulations numbered below (Fig. 2). An ASCII cat must be created using only one String.

### Fig. 1
```
Enter an adjective: cold
Enter a full name: Mary Sue 
Enter a location: library
Enter an object: painting
Enter a number: 10
Enter a city: Boston

... ADD ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ...
```
You **must** create this part of the story using only the input shown above. Repeating the adjective, splitting up the first and last name, generating initials, capitalizing, and repeating just the first letter as necessary:
```
One _cold cold_ day, _Mary Sue_ walked into a _library_. They walk up to the front and ask 
"Where can I find the _painting_ that I made?". The person replies 
"Well, let's see, what's your name?". 
"I'm _Mary_, _Mary Sue_." 
"Your initials?"
"_MS_"
"Oh! You're... THE _MARY SUE_! You are in the top _10_ in _Boston_! Your _p-p-painting_ is right over here."

```
### Fig. 2
1. Put an input into lowercase
2. Take only the last letter of the first and last names
3. Turn regular verbs into past tense (-ed) and present continuous (-ing)
